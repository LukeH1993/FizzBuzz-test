# The Task
We were asked to a create a simple 'fizzbuzz' program with a Test Driven
Development tester file that would analyse the functionality of the program.

# Functionality
The program generates numbers from one to a hundred, producing the word 'fizz'
for each number that is divisible by 3, 'buzz' for each number that is divisible
by 5, and 'fizzbuzz' for each word divisible by 15.

# Test
fizzbuzz_spec tests that the expected output for numbers is matched with the
expected outcomes.
